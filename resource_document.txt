Biofactor’s chemical fertilizers: Today the agricultural sector is facing harsher and more 
unpredictable weather conditions than ever before. Similarly, the soil’s nutrient capacity and 
microbial population are reduced. Al- though farmers use traditional chem ical fertilizers found in 
the market, the nutrient availability and utilization efficiency of plants has decreased due to the 
high particle size of these nutrients. To overcome these problems, Biofactor has developed the 
Microbe Metabolite Assisted Micron Sized Par ticles (MAMSP) technology, which uses microbes to 
microsize the particle size. All the products made using this technology have very small sized of 
nutrients. Thus the availability and utilization efficiency of nutrients to plants increases. They 
work with three times higher efficiency compared to regular fertilizers. Therefore the biofactor 
can get more results using less quantity of their chemical nutrients POTASSIUM THIOSULPHATE - 25% A 
liquid nutrient mixture that provides potassium. It contains 25% potash as well as calcium, boron 
and manganese required for flowering and fruiting de velopment. Formulated using MAMS (Microbe
